We are going start with a simple example, loading data from external cloud storage system (in this case S3) and load that data into database.

This is such a common use case, many systems support this natively. If you needed to load data from S3 into most data warehouses, this can be accomplished by running a SQL statement. However there are just as common cases where you need to do some amount of custom processing to this data. That is why is serves as a good first use case as we describe the various ways to perform ETL with Dagster.
