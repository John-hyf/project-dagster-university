# Overview

Welcome to extra credit, ambitious student!

By this point, you have a fully functional dbt project in Dagster. You've seen the power of converting individual dbt models into assets and integrating specific models with assets outside your dbt project.

This is a great achievement, though it required some setup. Now, we'll show you how to use [components](https://docs.dagster.io/guides/labs/components/) to streamline the process of incorporating a dbt project into Dagster.

Having completed the previous lessons, you'll better appreciate how components enhance workflows, simplify scaffolding, and help set up common integrations like dbt.
